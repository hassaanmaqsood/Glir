Just a simple glucose monitering through IR T/RX diodes with -30%/+10% error. 
Not upto the mark yet as it was made in 4 hours. Would make a better version and documentation by adding different LEDs to exclude the envoirment effect, still need to get into the other details as each person absorbs and emit different intensity of IR depending on activities and thier metabolism.

Here's a visual representation of current version
